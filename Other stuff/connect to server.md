1. First you have to create your own SSH key and send him to serve's admin (probably Arnaud) to get the permission
2. The server's link is here: 

ubuntu@compute2.dorsal.polymtl.ca
ubuntu@buildServer.dorsal.polymtl.ca

3. To check your SSh key:
4. 
```console
ls -l ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
```

```console
ssh rezghool@ubuntu@buildServer.dorsal.polymtl.ca
```
I got erros. why? beacause I sent Arnauld my pulic key from my laptop and now I'm on pc from lab :). So I have to copy my public and private key from my laptop to this pc. the solution is found here:â€Œ
