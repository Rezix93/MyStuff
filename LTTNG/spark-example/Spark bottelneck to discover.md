To transform the query language to a set of operations for execution, Spark creates the following set of execution plans:

Parsed logical plan — created when the code is correctly parsed.
Optimized logical plan — Catalyst further optimizes the logical plan.
Physical plan — Spark computes an execution plan for the cluster.
Improving the effectiveness of plan optimization was the focus for the latest major update of Spark. In this blog post I will focus on its two biggest features, namely Adaptive Query Execution and Dynamic Partition Pruning

1. **Executor and Core Configuration**: Determining the optimal number of executors and cores per executor for parallelization and efficient resource usage is a common challenge【680†source】.

2. **Memory Allocation**: Allocating the right amount of memory for each job and managing memory consumption effectively, especially in applications using caching, to avoid unnecessary disk spills or out-of-memory errors【680†source】【681†source】.

3. **Data Skew**: Identifying and eliminating data skew, which can lead to uneven distribution of workloads across nodes, significantly impacting performance【680†source】.

4. **Pipeline Optimization**: Improving the efficiency of data processing pipelines for better performance【680†source】.

5. **Partitioning**: Correctly partitioning data for operations, especially SQL queries, to optimize performance【680†source】.

6. **Serialized RDD Storage**: Utilizing serialized RDD storage for large objects to reduce memory usage, though it may lead to slower access times due to on-the-fly deserialization【681†source】.

7. **Garbage Collection (GC) Tuning**: Managing garbage collection effectively to reduce the overhead associated with the eviction of old objects and allocation of new ones. This includes configuring the JVM for garbage collection to minimize the impact on task execution【681†source】.

Based on the information gathered, here are some common Spark performance issues and bottlenecks that you might find easier to replicate, log, and analyze:

1. **Shuffle Operations**: These are often a source of bottlenecks in Spark applications, especially when working with large datasets. Shuffle operations require network communication and disk I/O, leading to significant performance degradation.
   - **To Implement and Log**: Introduce a wide transformation (e.g., `reduceByKey`, `groupBy`, etc.) on a large dataset and observe the shuffle read and write times in the logs.

2. **Skewed Data**: Data skew can cause an uneven distribution of workload across the cluster, leading to some tasks taking much longer than others.
   - **To Implement and Log**: Create an RDD or DataFrame with skewed data (e.g., a key-value pair where one key has significantly more values than others) and perform an operation that involves shuffling (e.g., `reduceByKey`). Log the execution times of tasks to identify the skew.

3. **Memory Management**: Improper memory management can lead to frequent garbage collection (GC) or out-of-memory errors.
   - **To Implement and Log**: Allocate insufficient memory to executors or persist large datasets in memory without proper tuning. Monitor GC activity and memory usage through Spark UI or logs.

4. **Disk I/O**: Excessive disk I/O, especially for operations that spill data to disk, can slow down the application.
   - **To Implement and Log**: Force operations that spill to disk by manipulating the size of data processed and the memory available. Look for spill metrics in task summaries.

5. **Resource Allocation**: Inefficient resource allocation (CPU cores, memory) can lead to underutilization or bottlenecks.
   - **To Implement and Log**: Configure your Spark application with suboptimal resource settings (e.g., too few cores, low memory) and observe the impact on task parallelism and execution times.
