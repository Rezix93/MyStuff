To make the `JavaPageRank` example more complex and potentially introduce an issue that can be observed in the Spark UI, we can modify the code to process a larger dataset or perform more computationally intensive operations. One common way to induce issues in Spark applications is to increase the amount of data being shuffled or to perform operations that are memory-intensive.

Here's a modified version of the `JavaPageRank` example with changes that are likely to make it more complex and resource-intensive:

### Modifications

1. **Increase the Number of Iterations**: More iterations of the PageRank algorithm will increase the computational workload.
   
2. **Artificially Inflate the Data**: We'll create additional links artificially to increase the size of the dataset being processed.

3. **Reduce the Level of Parallelism**: By repartitioning the data to a smaller number of partitions, we can increase the amount of data processed by each task, which might lead to resource constraints like out-of-memory errors.

### Modified JavaPageRank Code

```java
// ... [Previous imports and class declarations]

public final class JavaPageRank {
    private static final Pattern SPACES = Pattern.compile("\\s+");
    
    // ... [Previous methods]

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // ... [Existing argument checks and SparkSession creation]

        spark.sparkContext().addSparkListener(new MyCustomSparkListener());

        // ... [Existing code to load and process input file]

        // Artificially inflate the data and reduce the level of parallelism
        links = links.flatMapToPair(s -> {
            List<Tuple2<String, Iterable<String>>> newLinks = new ArrayList<>();
            newLinks.add(s);
            // Duplicate each link 10 times to increase dataset size
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                newLinks.add(new Tuple2<>(s._1 + "_copy" + i, s._2));
            }
            return newLinks.iterator();
        }).repartition(10); // Reduce the number of partitions

        // Initialize ranks
        JavaPairRDD<String, Double> ranks = links.mapValues(rs -> 1.0);

        // Increase the number of iterations to 20
        for (int current = 0; current < 20; current++) {
            // ... [Existing PageRank calculation logic]
        }

        // ... [Existing code to collect and print output]

        spark.stop();
    }
}
```

### Running the Modified Application

1. **Compile and Package**: After modifying the code, recompile and package your Spark application.

2. **Run with Limited Resources**: When running the application with `spark-submit`, you can specify limited resources to exacerbate potential issues. For example, use a small amount of memory for the executor:

   ```bash
     ${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit \
   --verbose \
   --class org.apache.spark.examples.JavaPageRank2 \
   --master local[2] \
   /opt/spark/examples/target/scala-2.12/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.4.0.jar \
   1000 10
   ```
```bash
./sbin/start-history-server.sh

pgrep -a lttng-sessiond

cd /opt/spark/
./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package
  ```


3. **Monitor in Spark UI**: Once running, open the Spark UI (usually at `http://localhost:4040`). Look for signs of resource bottlenecks, such as task failures, executor loss, or excessive garbage collection time.

### Observation and Analysis

- In the Spark UI, observe the stages and tasks for signs of issues. 
- Check the event timeline and executor tabs for insights into resource usage and potential causes of any observed problems.

By making these changes, the `JavaPageRank` application will be more likely to encounter issues such as running out of memory, especially if run with constrained resources. Monitoring the application in the Spark UI will provide valuable insights into how Spark behaves under stress and how resource-related issues manifest.
