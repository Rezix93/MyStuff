In Apache Spark, you should strategically place instrumentation or log statements in various parts of your code to monitor and analyze the behavior and performance of your Spark application. Here are some key areas and components where you can instrument your Spark application:

1. **Driver Program**:
   - The driver program is the entry point of your Spark application. You can instrument it to capture high-level application-level events and control flow.

2. **SparkSession or SparkContext Initialization**:
   - Instrument the initialization of the `SparkSession` or `SparkContext` to capture configuration settings and the creation of the Spark context.

3. **Job Submission**:
   - Instrument the code that submits Spark jobs. This is where you trigger the execution of Spark tasks and stages.

4. **Control Flow**:
   - Add instrumentation to key control flow points, such as job scheduling, waiting for job completion, and handling application exits.

5. **Data Ingestion and Output**:
   - If your application involves data ingestion from external sources or writing data to external storage, add instrumentation at these points to monitor data flow.

6. **Application-Specific Logic**:
   - Depending on your application, add instrumentation to monitor application-specific logic and operations.

7. **Job Execution**:
   - Instrument your Spark jobs to capture task-level details, stages, and job progress. You can place log statements within transformations, actions, and key operations.

8. **Shuffling and Data Exchange**:
   - Monitor shuffle operations, which can be resource-intensive. Instrumentation in the ShuffleManager or BlockManager can provide insights into shuffling behavior.

9. **Error Handling and Recovery**:
   - Instrument code responsible for error handling, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms to ensure the robustness of your Spark application.

10. **Resource Management**:
    - Instrument functions that manage cluster resources and resource allocation. This can help you optimize resource utilization.

11. **Custom Algorithms and User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**:
    - If your application includes custom algorithms or UDFs, instrument these components, especially if they are central to your application's logic.

12. **Metrics Collection**:
    - Use Spark's built-in metrics system or custom metrics to capture performance and behavior metrics.

13. **Logging Framework**:
    - Utilize a logging framework such as Log4j or SLF4J to add log statements to various components. This helps you capture both regular logs and traces for debugging and analysis.

14. **Custom Spark Extensions**:
    - If you have custom extensions or components integrated into Spark (e.g., custom schedulers, data sources, or plugins), add instrumentation to these custom components.

15. **Cluster Manager Integration**:
    - If your Spark cluster is integrated with a cluster manager like YARN or Mesos, instrument integration points for monitoring resource allocation and job submission.

The specific locations for instrumentation depend on your application's complexity and goals. The level of instrumentation, as well as the use of log statements, will vary based on your debugging and monitoring needs. Be cautious about the performance impact of excessive instrumentation, as it can affect the overall performance of your Spark application.

Instrumenting the Apache Spark source code requires a deep understanding of Spark's architecture and your specific use case. Below, I'll suggest some locations within the Spark source code where you can consider adding instrumentation, but keep in mind that the choice of where to instrument may vary depending on your goals.

1. **DAGScheduler**:
   - For tracing job scheduling and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution, look in the `DAGScheduler` component. You can add instrumentation in methods related to job submission, stage creation, and task scheduling.

2. **TaskScheduler**:
   - Instrument methods within the `TaskScheduler` and its implementations to monitor task scheduling and distribution across workers.

3. **Task**:
   - Trace task execution by adding instrumentation within the `Task` class, especially in the `run` method, which is responsible for executing tasks on workers.

4. **RDD**:
   - Instrument RDD operations, such as transformations and actions, to understand how data is processed. Consider adding traces to methods like `map`, `reduce`, and `collect` within the RDD class.

5. **ShuffleManager**:
   - Monitor shuffling behavior by placing instrumentation within the `ShuffleManager` and its implementations. This is essential for tracing data shuffling.

6. **BlockManager**:
   - Capture block management and data exchange between nodes by adding traces within the `BlockManager` component.

7. **MapOutputTracker**:
   - Trace map output tracking by adding instrumentation within the `MapOutputTracker` to understand how map output data is managed.

8. **Cluster Manager Integration**:
   - Instrument integration points with cluster managers like YARN or Mesos for monitoring resource allocation and job submission. These integration points are in Spark's external cluster manager client libraries.

9. **MetricCollectionSource**:
   - If you want to capture Spark metrics, consider instrumenting the `MetricCollectionSource` to gather performance and behavior metrics.

10. **Logging Framework**:
    - Utilize Spark's built-in logging framework (usually Log4j or SLF4J) by adding log statements to various components. You can capture both regular logs and traces for debugging and analysis.

11. **Custom Spark Extensions**:
    - If you have custom extensions or components integrated into Spark (e.g., custom schedulers, data sources, or plugins), add instrumentation to these custom components based on their specific functionality.

    Running a Spark application using `javac` and `spark-submit` are two different approaches, and they serve different purposes in the context of running Spark applications:

1. **Compiling with `javac`**:

   - When you use `javac`, you are compiling your Spark application's source code into Java bytecode (`.class` files).
   - This approach is typically used during development to ensure that your code compiles without errors.
   - You can run your compiled Java classes directly using the `java` command, but this doesn't take advantage of Spark's cluster computing capabilities. Instead, it runs your code as a standard Java application on a single machine.
   - It's suitable for local testing and debugging but not for distributed processing.

2. **Running with `spark-submit`**:

   - `spark-submit` is a command-line script provided by Apache Spark that's used to submit Spark applications to a Spark cluster. It's the recommended way to run Spark applications.
   - When you use `spark-submit`, you package your application code, along with dependencies, into a JAR file or submit it as a Python script.
   - `spark-submit` takes care of launching your Spark application on the cluster, managing resources, and distributing the tasks across the cluster nodes. It also handles configuration and cluster-specific settings.
   - It's the preferred method for deploying Spark applications in a production environment and making use of Spark's distributed computing capabilities.

In summary, the key difference is that `javac` is used for compiling Java code into bytecode, while `spark-submit` is used for submitting Spark applications to a Spark cluster for distributed processing. To leverage Spark's distributed processing capabilities and to run your application on a cluster, it's recommended to use `spark-submit`. During development and testing, you might use `javac` and local execution to verify that your code is functioning correctly.

Please note that instrumenting Spark source code is a complex task, and it requires a deep understanding of Spark's internals. Be sure to follow best practices for 
debugging and tracing to avoid overwhelming the logs with excessive trace information. Additionally, consider using log levels and configurations to control the amount of information captured during different stages of Spark execution.
