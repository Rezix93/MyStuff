To gather detailed information about the threads that are running Spark tasks, you should place your logging statements in the parts of the Spark codebase that directly manage task execution. In the context of Apache Spark, this is typically handled in the `Executor` class, particularly within methods that manage the lifecycle of tasks such as `launchTask`, `run`, and the task completion or failure handling.

Here are strategic points in the `Executor` class to insert your logging statements for monitoring thread behavior:

### 1. **When Tasks are Launched**
Insert logging at the start of the `launchTask` method in the `Executor.scala` file to log when a task starts its execution. This is important to track which thread begins to handle a task.

```scala
def launchTask(context: ExecutorBackend, taskDescription: TaskDescription): Unit = {
  val taskId = taskDescription.taskId
  val tr = createTaskRunner(context, taskDescription)
  logger.info(s"Launching task $taskId from thread ${Thread.currentThread().getId} (Name: ${Thread.currentThread().getName})")
  runningTasks.put(taskId, tr)
  threadPool.execute(tr)
  // Other code...
}
```

### 2. **Inside the TaskRunner**
Since `TaskRunner` runs the task, adding logging inside the `run` method of the `TaskRunner` class will help you track exactly when and where (which thread) each task is executed:

```scala
override def run(): Unit = {
  threadId = Thread.currentThread().getId
  val threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName
  logger.info(s"Running task $taskId on thread $threadId (Name: $threadName)")
  // Execution code...
}
```

### 3. **Handling Task Completion and Failure**
To understand when a task completes or fails, including the thread involved, add logs in the catch and finally blocks within the `run` method:

```scala
try {
  // Task execution logic...
} catch {
  case t: Throwable =>
    logger.error(s"Task $taskId failed on thread $threadId", t)
} finally {
  logger.info(s"Task $taskId completed/failed on thread $threadId")
}
```

### 4. **During Task Decommissioning or Killing**
If tasks are killed due to an executor being decommissioned or other reasons, log these actions:

```scala
def killTask(taskId: Long, interruptThread: Boolean, reason: String): Unit = {
  logger.info(s"Killing task $taskId on thread ${Thread.currentThread().getId} for reason: $reason")
  val taskRunner = runningTasks.get(taskId)
  if (taskRunner != null) {
    taskRunner.kill(interruptThread = interruptThread, reason = reason)
  }
}
```

### Why These Locations?
- **Task Launch and Execution**: These logs will tell you when and on which thread each task starts and operates, providing insight into task distribution and thread utilization.
- **Completion and Failure Handling**: Knowing which thread a task completes or fails on can help identify thread-specific issues or behavior, especially in multi-threaded environments.
- **Task Killing**: This is crucial for understanding task lifecycle interruptions and ensuring that resource cleanup or other necessary actions are handled correctly.

By placing logging statements at these points, you can gain a comprehensive view of how tasks are managed across different threads within Spark's executor service. This is invaluable for debugging, performance tuning, and ensuring optimal resource utilization in your Spark applications.
