```
cd ~/research/eclipse  
 WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1
./eclipse
```
2. I opened the TC and lots of Erros
   How to solve it: 1. look at erros: We see somthing like java and permission and we undestarnd
   This is regarding to running java in sudo mode already ->
   2.1. We have to remove build files
   2.2 back to TC and clean the project

3. For having Trace compass Do no download the file and Import it. sync it from Github.

`File -> import -> git > Project from Git -> Existing local repossitory`
