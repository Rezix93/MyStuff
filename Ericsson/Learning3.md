### 1. API baseline:
An API baseline is a `reference point` used in software development to track and compare changes to an API over time. It serves as a snapshot of the API at a specific point in time, usually corresponding to a released version. By comparing the current state of the API against the baseline, developers can identify changes, ensure backward compatibility, and detect any unintended breakages.
#### Key Concepts of API Baselines

1. **Reference Point**:  2. **Backward Compatibility**:  3. **Change Detection**: 4. **Versioning**: 
#### Benefits of Using an API Baseline

- **Consistency**: Helps maintain a consistent API for users and developers.
- **Quality Assurance**: Provides a mechanism to check for accidental changes or breakages.
- **Documentation**: Assists in generating accurate change logs and documentation by highlighting differences from the baseline.
- **Compliance**: Ensures compliance with API design and versioning policies.

2. An example of depricate Fucntion in java:

```
  /**
    @Deprecated
    protected void handleGroupedCounterAspect(ITmfEvent event, ITmfStateSystemBuilder ss, CounterAspect aspect, int rootQuark) {
        handleGroupedCounterAspect(event, ss, rootQuark, aspect);
    }

 protected void handleGroupedCounterAspect(ITmfEvent event, ITmfStateSystemBuilder ss, int rootQuark, ITmfCounterAspect aspect) {
        }
```
