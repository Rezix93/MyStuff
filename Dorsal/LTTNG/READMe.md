To successfully capture logs in an LTTng session, several modifications are required in the Apache Spark environment. These changes ensure proper integration and functionality. Specifically, the following components need to be included:

1. **`lttng-ust-agent-log4j.jar`**: This JAR file acts as an agent for Log4j, facilitating the logging process and enabling it to work seamlessly with LTTng.

2. **`lttng-ust-agent-common.jar`**: This JAR file contains common functionalities required by the LTTng UST agents. It ensures that the necessary logging infrastructure is in place for both Log4j and other supported logging frameworks.

3. **`liblttng-ust-log4j-jni.so`**: This shared library (JNI) provides the native interface needed for LTTng to interact with Log4j. It acts as a bridge between the Java application and the native LTTng UST libraries.

By incorporating these components into your Apache Spark setup, you can enable efficient and detailed logging through LTTng, enhancing your ability to monitor and troubleshoot the application.

To capture logs in an LTTng session for Apache Spark, you need to make specific changes to the `spark-defaults.conf` file. This involves adding the necessary JAR files and setting the library paths for both the driver and the executor. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Add JARs to the Driver Classpath:**
   You need to specify the classpath for the driver to include the required LTTng agent JARs and the JNI library. Uncomment and modify the following line in your `spark-defaults.conf`:

   ```properties
   # Add jars to driver classpath
   spark.driver.extraClassPath /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni:/opt/spark/core/target/jars/lttng-agent/lttng-ust-agent-common.jar:/opt/spark/core/target/jars/lttng-agent/lttng-ust-agent-log4j2.jar:/opt/spark/core/target/jars/lttng-agent/lttng-ust-agent-log4j.jar
   ```

2. **Add JARs to the Executor Classpath:**
   Similarly, you need to set the classpath for the executor to include the necessary JARs and JNI library. Uncomment and modify the following line:

   ```properties
   # Add jars to executor classpath
   spark.executor.extraClassPath /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/jni:/opt/spark/core/target/jars/lttng-agent/lttng-ust-agent-common.jar:/opt/spark/core/target/jars/lttng-agent/lttng-ust-agent-log4j2.jar:/opt/spark/core/target/jars/lttng-ust-agent-log4j.jar
   ```

3. **Alternatively, Set Java Library Path:**
   If you prefer to set the Java library path instead, you can add the following options:

   ```properties
   spark.executor.extraJavaOptions      -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/
   spark.driver.extraJavaOptions        -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/
   ```

4. **Set the Classpath for All JARs:**
   Ensure all required JARs are included by setting the classpath as follows:

   ```properties
   spark.driver.extraClassPath           /usr/local/share/java/*
   spark.executor.extraClassPath         /usr/local/share/java/*
   ```

By making these configurations, you ensure that Apache Spark has the necessary dependencies and paths set up to effectively capture logs using LTTng. Make sure to adjust the paths based on the actual locations of the JAR files and libraries on your system.
