To successfully capture logs in an LTTng session, several modifications are required in the Apache Spark environment. These changes ensure proper integration and functionality. Specifically, the following components need to be included:

1. **`lttng-ust-agent-log4j.jar`**: This JAR file acts as an agent for Log4j, facilitating the logging process and enabling it to work seamlessly with LTTng.

2. **`lttng-ust-agent-common.jar`**: This JAR file contains common functionalities required by the LTTng UST agents. It ensures that the necessary logging infrastructure is in place for both Log4j and other supported logging frameworks.

3. **`liblttng-ust-log4j-jni.so`**: This shared library (JNI) provides the native interface needed for LTTng to interact with Log4j. It acts as a bridge between the Java application and the native LTTng UST libraries.

By incorporating these components into your Apache Spark setup, you can enable efficient and detailed logging through LTTng, enhancing your ability to monitor and troubleshoot the application.
