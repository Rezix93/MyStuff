# Spark LTTng and Trace Compass Research

This repository contains the latest version of the code for my research involving Apache Spark, LTTng, and Trace Compass. The project focuses on capturing logs from Apache Spark, recording them in LTTng sessions, and analyzing them using Trace Compass to gain insights into application performance and behavior.

## Usage
1. **Capture Logs**: Use the provided scripts to capture logs from your Spark applications.
2. **Record with LTTng**: Set up and start LTTng sessions to record the captured logs.
3. **Analyze with Trace Compass**: Import the recorded logs into Trace Compass for detailed analysis.

## Requirements
- Apache Spark
- LTTng
- Eclipse Trace Compass

Feel free to explore the code and use it for your research or projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
